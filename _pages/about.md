## 🎓 About Me

I am a **Ph.D. student (ECE)** at the **University of Maryland, College Park**, advised by Prof. [Ang Li](https://www.ang-li.com/).
Before that, I received my **B.E. in Computer Engineering** from **Wuhan University**, where I worked with Prof. [Qian Wang](http://nisplab.whu.edu.cn/).
I have been fortunate to intern at **IBM Research (Summer 2024)** and **Sony AI (Summer 2025)**, working on **collaborative and efficient foundation models**.

I am broadly interested in making foundation models **more collaborative, more efficient, and more reliable**.

## 🔍 Research Interests

My research focuses on collaborative foundation models and practical efficiency, spanning:

- **Federated & collaborative foundation models** (federated fine-tuning, personalization, communication-efficiency)
