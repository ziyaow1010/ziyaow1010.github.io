Iâ€™m currently a third-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Maryland, College Park, advised by Prof. [Ang Li](https://www.ang-li.com/). My research interests include foundation models, edge AI, security and privacy. Before that, I received my B.E. in Computer Engineering from Wuhan University. I worked as a research intern at IBM Research (2024 summer) and Sony AI (2025 summer) on the topic of collaborative and efficient foundation models.
